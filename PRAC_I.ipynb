        "Figures 3.2 and 3.3 show that both the total cost and the credit earned per project per year have relatively low mean values, indicating that most projects fall on the lower end of the cost and credit distribution. The presence of numerous outliers suggests that the dataset contains several high-value projects, contributing to a high level of variability. This pattern implies that while most Brownfield projects are modest in scale, a few large projects significantly influence the overall distribution."

        "Conclusion\n",
        "This analysis provides a comprehensive view of brownfield redevelopment activities across New York State, focusing on annual development trends, environmental zone distribution, regional participation, and financial patterns. The findings reveal that brownfield redevelopment has generally increased over the years, reflecting the growing impact of state-level environmental policies and financial incentives. Although environmental zones initially showed fluctuating development activity, the overall trend indicates improved participation, suggesting the policy’s effectiveness in encouraging developers to remediate high-priority areas.\n",
        "New York City, Lower Hudson Valley, and Western New York consistently lead in the number of brownfield projects, highlighting strong developer engagement and greater demand for urban redevelopment. Financial analysis shows a strong positive relationship between total project cost and total credit earned, particularly evident in the high correlation (0.72) between total property component cost (tpc_cost) and total credit. This suggests that larger, more complex projects often yield higher incentives, as intended by policy design.\n",
        "Spatial analysis further indicates that brownfield sites are concentrated within specific regions, particularly New York City and Long Island, which may be influenced by industrial history, land availability, or regional economic needs. However, some regions such as Eastern Adirondack and certain rural counties show limited development activity, indicating potential gaps in uptake or accessibility.\n",
        "Overall, while the Brownfield Cleanup Program appears to be driving redevelopment, regional disparity, site clustering, and project variability highlight areas where strategic policy reinforcement could enhance balanced environmental and economic outcomes.\n",

        "Recommendations\n",
        "1. Strengthen Support for Low-Activity Regions\n",
        "Regions such as Eastern Adirondack and parts of Long Island show limited redevelopment. Targeted incentives such as higher credit multipliers, reduced application barriers, or technical assistance could encourage developer participation in these areas.\n",
        "2. Enhance Awareness and Outreach Programs\n",
        "Some developers, especially smaller firms, may lack awareness of available credits or face administrative challenges. Clearer guidelines, training workshops, and improved communication from state agencies would support wider program adoption.\n",
        "4. Encourage Sustainable Redevelopment\n",
        "Only about 20.4% of brownfield sites are converted to sustainable housing. Expanding incentives for green buildings, renewable energy integration, or affordable housing development could increase socially responsible outcomes.\n",
        "5. Strengthen Environmental-Zone Targeting\n",
        "Given that 55% of brownfield sites lie within environmental zones, continued monitoring is essential. Reviewing policy effectiveness annually can ensure these zones continue to receive priority redevelopment attention.\n",
        "6. Promote Regional Collaboration\n",
        "Sharing best practices among high-performing regions (e.g., NYC, Western New York) and low-performing regions can help transfer technical and administrative knowledge, improving statewide performance.\n",
